## Achivify 📚🏃
Achivify is your go-to platform for tracking your progress in your studies, just like you would track your runs. 📊

**Motivation**
One of the main things that motivates me to run outdoors is the ability to see various metrics on my phone screen after the run. It's incredible to look at graphs and data that show which days I've run, for how long, and to check average pace, distance, and length. This inspired me to bring the same level of tracking and motivation to my studies. 🏃‍♂️📱

**What is Achivify?**
Achivify is a personal project born from the desire to monitor my progress in answering the "300 JavaScript Developer Questions." I've put in the effort to provide manual answers to these questions, although I have used AI to generate some code examples for efficiency. 🚀🧠

**How It Works**
Achivify allows you to create an account and input the number of hours you've dedicated to studying each day. You can also mark which questions from the "300 JavaScript Developer Questions" you've already learned. The platform compiles this data and presents it to you in a user-friendly dashboard, providing valuable insights into your study journey. 📈📚
